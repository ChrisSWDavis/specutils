This directory contains sample data files, if available, that ``specviz`` can
load using the loaders that are packaged with the software.
Due to proprietary nature of some data used for testing, not all data files
are currently available; They are listed as "N/A" in the table below.
By inspecting the respective data format and its associated YAML file, user
should be able to create their own YAML files for custom formats.
