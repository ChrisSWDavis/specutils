Introduction
============

Pyfocal is a tool for 1-D spectral visualization and analysis of astronomical
spectrograms. It is written in Python thus can be run anywhere Python is
supported (see :ref:`doc_installation`).
Pyfocal is capable of reading data from FITS and ASCII tables.

Once ingested, data can be plotted and examined with a large selection of
custom settings. Pyfocal supports instrument-specific data quality handling,
flexible spectral units conversions, custom plotting attributes,
plot annotations, tiled plots, etc.

A spectral feature quick measurement tool enables the user, with a few mouse
actions, to perform and record measurements on selected spectral features.

Pyfocal can be used to build wide-band SEDs, overploting or combining data from
the same astronomical source taken with different instruments and/or spectral
bands. Data can be further processed with averaging, splicing, detrending,
and Fourier filtering tools.

Pyfocal has a spectral model fitting capability that enables the user to work
with multi-component models in a number of ways, and fit models to data.
For more details, see :ref:`doc_model_fitting`.

Support exists for overplotting and interactively renormalize data from
spectral templates.

Pyfocal can overplot spectral line identifications taken from a variety of
line lists.
