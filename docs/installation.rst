Installation
============
Installing with pip
-------------------
While, currently, Pyfocal is not an official PyPI package due to being in such early constant development, ``pip`` is
none-the-less among the easiest means of installing it. ::

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/nmearl/pyfocal.git

Installing from source
----------------------
You may also clone the repository directory somewhere on your local machine and install from there. ::

    $ git clone https://github.com/nmearl/pyfocal.git
    $ cd pyfocal
    $ python setup.py install

Launching from command line
---------------------------
For either way in which you chose to install, you may now launch Pyfocal from anywhere on your system by entering the
 following into your terminal::

    $ pyfocal
