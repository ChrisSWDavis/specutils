    <br />

Specutils is an `Astropy`_ affiliated package with the goal of providing a
shared set of Python representations of astronomical spectra, and basic tools to
operate on these spectra.  The effort is also meant to be a "hub", helping to
unite the Python astronomical spectroscopy community around shared effort, much
as `Astropy`_ is meant to for the wider astronomy Python ecosystem.

Note that Specutils is *not* intended as an all-in-one spectroscopic analysis or
reduction tool.  While it provides some baseline analysis (following the Python
philosophy of "batteries included"), it is also meant to facilitate connecting
together disparate reduction pipelines and analysis tools through shared data
representations.
